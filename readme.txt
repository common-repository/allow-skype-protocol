A simple plugin to allow Skype protocol in a link.

== Description ==

[Skype URIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skype-sdk/skypeuris/skypeuris) provide the ability to insert links into your website which will launch the Skype app when clicked.

But the Skype protocol is not whitelisted in WordPress, and URL beginning by **skype** is stripped by WordPress.

This plugin is adding the **skype** protocol to the whitelist. It's based on the code provided by [Chris from sevenspark.com](https://sevenspark.com/tutorials/skype-uri-link-wordpress-menu)

Thank you very much Chris!

== Installation ==

To use Allow Skype Protocol:

1. Go to **Plugins > Add New**
1. Under **Search**, type in the name of the WordPress Plugin : *Allow Skype Protocol*
1. Click **Install Now**, then **Proceed**
1. If successful, click **Activate Plugin** to activate it
1. You are now ready to use Skype links anywhere on your WordPress
